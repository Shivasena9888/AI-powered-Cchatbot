Project Overview:
This is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Flask, TensorFlow, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes a trained deep learning model to classify user input and deliver appropriate responses. The chatbot interface is designed with chat bubbles, avatars, and smooth animations for an engaging user experience.

📌 Features
• Accurately predicts user intent using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow
• Delivers relevant, pre-defined responses based on classified intent
• Interactive web interface created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
• Includes user and bot avatars along with animated chat bubbles for a real-time feel
• Easily deployable both locally and on cloud platforms like Replit or Render

🛠️ Technologies Used
• Python – Core programming language
• Flask – Lightweight web framework for handling API routes and serving the UI
• TensorFlow – For training and executing the intent classification model
• NLTK – Used for text preprocessing like tokenization and lemmatization
• HTML / CSS / JavaScript – To build and style the frontend chatbot interface
